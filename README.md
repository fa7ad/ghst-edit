# [ghst-edit](https://github.com/fa7ad/ghst-edit): Ghost's Markdown Editor (resurrected?)

## Background

This is my attempt at resurrecting Ghost's old markdown editor as a standalone editor.

This is largely based on the works of [@ig3](https://github.com/ig3/ghosditor), [@durgesh-priyaranjan](https://github.com/durgesh-priyaranjan/ghosditor), and [@timsayshey](https://github.com/timsayshey/Ghost-Markdown-Editor).

## Goals / Roadmap
* [x] Dockerize and simplify the development process
* [ ] Create a desktop app (electron)
* [ ] Add support for saving/opening markdown files
...
* [ ] (maybe) Try to update the codebase to not rely on jQuery?
